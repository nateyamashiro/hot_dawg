# HANDOFF — Steal a Glizzy 🌭

**Last updated:** 2026-07-07
**For:** the next Claude Code session (and Nate)

---

## 👉 What the NEXT session should do

**Playtest & tune Milestones 2 + 3 in a real 2-player Studio session.** Everything through M3 is
BUILT and passes static checks (rojo build + selene + stylua all clean) but has **not been
playtested with two live players** — that's the outstanding validation for M2 *and* the whole M3
progression layer added 2026-07-03.

1. **Two-player Studio playtest** (Test → **Clients and Servers**, 2 players; enable
   **Game Settings → Security → API Services** for DataStore). Confirm the M2 loop (plots assign,
   cook fills pedestals with top dogs vaulted, steal-carry-deposit transfers permanently, Net/guard
   drop carriers, newbie shield blocks steals) **and** the new M3 systems:
   - Spawn beside your own stand; it's highlighted + "🏠 YOUR STAND"; rival stands hide
     Vault/Deposit labels; no Steal prompt on your own dogs.
   - Buy grill/display/vault upgrades (🛒 Upgrades) → odds improve, more pedestals/vault fill.
   - Rebirth (✨) resets coins, keeps dogs + upgrades, bumps income & the `Rebirths` leaderstat.
   - Rejoin after time away → capped offline coins + "welcome back" popup.
   - 📖 Dex fills as you collect (completion reward once); 🍳 Cook ×10 + pity + odds shown.
   - 📅 Daily streak claim + 3 missions track and pay out.
2. **Tune** the reasoned numbers in `GAME_DESIGN §6` (`GameConfig.luau` / `HotDogDex.luau`) to feel —
   none are playtest-confirmed yet.
3. Then pick up the **M3 remainder / M4** (rotating shop, prestige spending, events, leaderboards,
   achievements). See `docs/ROADMAP.md` and `docs/BACKLOG.md`.

**Fast-follows still open inside M2:** traps, manual vault selection.
Do NOT re-ask what's already locked (see below / CLAUDE.md / `GAME_DESIGN.md §2, §4`).

## ⚠️ M3-specific gotchas / notes

- **DataStore is now `_v4`** (`DataManager.luau`). `_v3` saves back-fill cleanly. If you add
  PlayerData fields, bump to `_v5` and back-fill from defaults (keep `defaultData()` building fresh
  tables).
- **Join-race handshake:** the server pushes per-player state on join, but every client script also
  fires a `RequestState` remote after its handlers connect, and the server re-sends all state (see
  `Main.pushAllState`). Offline earnings are stashed in `pendingWelcome` and delivered via that path
  so the popup can't be lost. Any new server→client "initial state" push should be added to
  `pushAllState` and requested the same way.
- **Slot capacity is upgrade-derived.** `PlotManager.buildPlot` pre-builds `MaxDisplaySlots` /
  `MaxVaultSlots` anchors; `syncDisplay` only fills up to the player's current level. Empty extra
  pedestals are intentional "buy to unlock" slots.
- **Grill feeds the roll:** `HotDogDex.roll(grillLvl, guaranteeRare)` — pity passes `guaranteeRare`.
  `HotDogDex.odds(grillLvl)` and `HotDogDex.all()` back the cook-odds UI and the dex.

## ✅ Already locked (don't re-litigate)

- Genre: steal-and-defend idle tycoon · Theme: hot dogs, 7 rarity tiers · Title: "Steal a Glizzy"
- Ambition: **go big / commercial** · Audience: **everyone / Gen Alpha core**
- Monetization: passes/dev-products/cosmetics OK, but **gacha rolls are coin-only, never Robux**
- Art: **AI-generated in Studio** (mesh/4D generation)

## 🧱 What's built (Milestone 1)

A working cook-and-collect vertical slice, all server-authoritative:

- **`HotDogDex.luau`** — 7 rarity tiers (Common→Secret), 14 hot dogs, weighted `roll()`,
  income-per-second per tier, rarity colors.
- **Cook loop** — client fires `CookHotDog` RemoteEvent → server charges `CookCost` (10 coins),
  rolls, adds to `data.hotDogs` inventory, fires `CookResult` back → client shows a
  rarity-colored reveal.
- **Idle income** — passive coins/sec = sum of owned dogs' rates, ticked in `Main.server.luau`.
- **Persistence** — `DataManager.luau` saves `{coins, hotDogs={name=count}}` per player via
  DataStore (pcall-guarded; needs "Enable Studio Access to API Services" to persist in Studio).
- **UI** — coins/dogs HUD + cook button, built entirely in code.

## ▶️ How to run / test

1. In the project root: `~/.rokit/bin/rojo.exe serve default.project.json`
   (a server may already be running on port 34872 — that's fine, it live-watches the folder).
2. Roblox Studio → open a **Baseplate**.
3. If the Rojo Studio plugin isn't installed: VS Code → `Ctrl+Shift+P` → **"Rojo: Open Menu"** → install plugin.
4. Studio → Plugins tab → **Rojo** → **Connect**.
5. Press **Play**. Expect `💰 50  🌭 0`, a Cook button, rarity-colored reveals, coins ticking.

## 🔧 Validate before committing

```
~/.rokit/bin/rojo.exe build default.project.json --output build.rbxlx   # must succeed
~/.rokit/bin/selene.exe src/                                            # must be 0/0
~/.rokit/bin/stylua.exe src/                                            # auto-format
```

## ⚠️ Gotchas / lessons learned

- **luau-lsp false errors:** the PostToolUse diagnostic snapshot often reports plain-Lua parse
  errors (flags `:` type annotations, `::` casts) taken *before* the LSP re-parses. If
  `rojo build` + `selene` pass, the code is fine. `Ctrl+Shift+P → "Developer: Reload Window"`
  clears lingering squiggles.
- **Rokit + non-TTY shell:** `rokit add <tool>` refuses until trusted. Run `rokit trust owner/repo`
  first (there IS a `rokit trust` subcommand), then `rokit add`.
- **`rojo plugin install` fails** here ("Couldn't find registry keys") — install the Studio
  plugin via the VS Code Rojo extension instead.
- **DataStore data-shape changes:** bump the `_vN` suffix in `DataManager.luau`'s store name to
  avoid loading incompatible old data.
- **Shallow-copy bug avoided:** `DataManager.defaultData()` builds a fresh table each call so no
  two players alias the same `hotDogs` table. Keep it that way.
